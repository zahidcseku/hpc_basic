This repository contains code and instructions for training large-scale machine learning models using High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

## Overview

As machine learning models and datasets grow in size and complexity, training them on a single machine becomes impractical. This project demonstrates how to leverage HPC resources to train ML models on large datasets efficiently.

## Contents

- `parallel_processing.py`: Example script showing how to adapt code for parallel processing.
- `job_submission.sh`: SLURM job submission script template.
- `data_preprocessing/`: Scripts for preparing and splitting large datasets.
- `model_training/`: ML model training scripts optimized for HPC environments.
- `result_analysis/`: Scripts for aggregating and analyzing results from parallel jobs.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an HPC cluster with SLURM job scheduler
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Transfer the necessary files to your HPC environment.
3. Modify the `job_submission.sh` script to fit your specific HPC environment and resource needs.
4. Adapt your ML model code using the patterns shown in `parallel_processing.py`.
5. Submit your job using: `sbatch job_submission.sh`

## Best Practices

- Always test your code on a small subset of data before submitting large jobs.
- Use appropriate file systems for different stages of your workflow (e.g., $SCRATCH for temporary data, $HOME for scripts).
- Monitor your job's resource usage and adjust as necessary.
- Remember to transfer your results to persistent storage after job completion.
